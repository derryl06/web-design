          <h4>Lupin</h4>
          <p>
            Lupin is a French mystery thriller streaming television series
            created by George Kay and François Uzan that premiered on Netflix on
            8 January 2021. The series consists of ten episodes, with the first
            five released in January 2021 and the remainder on 11 June 2021.[2]
            Netflix has renewed Lupin for a third part.[3] The show stars Omar
            Sy in the role of Assane Diop, a man who is inspired by the
            adventures of master thief Arsène Lupin, a character created by
            Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s.[4] The first part, consisting of
            five episodes, is subtitled Dans l'ombre d'Arsène (In the Shadow of
            Arsène), referring to the primary character's inspiration.[5][6] The
            series was watched by 70 million households during its first month,
            becoming the most-watched non-English series on Netflix at the
            time.[7]
